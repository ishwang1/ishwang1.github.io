I am a research associate from Department of Economics, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). I studied at Tongji University (BEng, MEng) and The Chinese University of Hong Kong (MSc, PhD). I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Zhentao Shi](https://zhentaoshi.github.io/), Professor [Xiaohu Wang](https://sites.google.com/site/frankxiaohuwang/), and Professor [Xun Lu](https://teacher.econ.cuhk.edu.hk/~xunlu/). 

My research interests include high-dimensional econometrics, time series, machine learning application in economics, and causal inference.
